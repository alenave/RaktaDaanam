In desperate times of accidents, or diseases, it becomes highly chaotic to find someone with the same blood group that we need. Yes, there are portals, there are blood banks, but still finding a donor who can come as soon as you call, is rare. Some times you get donors but they are very far away and might refuse to come. What we want to build is an app that along with other information keeps a record of your blood group. The moment you need blood, you tell it (your's or the needy's blood group) and it will find a donor who can donate the blood (based on the blood facts), within the specified radius based on the GPS location. It will also keep a record of people who have not yet completed 3 months after their last donation and will not pick them up."
